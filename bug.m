In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with the `retain`, `release`, and `autorelease` methods.  Consider this scenario:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)dealloc {
    [myString release];
    [super dealloc];
}
@end

// ... in some other method ...
MyClass *myObject = [[MyClass alloc] init];
myObject.myString = [[NSString alloc] initWithString: @"Hello"];
[myObject release]; // Potential memory leak here
```

The problem lies in the fact that `myObject.myString` is retained by `myObject`. When you release `myObject`, it's dealloc method gets called, which releases `myString`. However, if you fail to release `myString` before releasing `myObject`  using `[myString release];` you might not get any warning or error. But you are likely to have a memory leak. You might observe a gradual memory increase in your application until it crashes. This is more difficult to detect than other runtime errors
